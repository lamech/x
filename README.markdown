I find myself working differently with music than I used to. Especially these
days when time seems to feel so fragmented, much of my musical activity (both
music-making and music-listening) is interstitial -- I'm drawn to things I can
listen to (and music I can write) in between other things, in a semi-distracted state. Why fight it?

In particular, I've been applying my coding "chops" as a means of musical
activity, mostly in [csound](http://csounds.com); although my time is
fragmented, the musical results are certainly more composed than the stuff I've
done in the past.

** What This Is **

This is a place for me to collect little tidbits, ideas, fragments, maybe even
finished pieces. I'm figuring out how to use the materials as I go, so it starts
with a project to explore csound as a means of making the music I want to make.
That involves figuring out how to do some stuff with csound that I don't see
other people doing. Keeping it all organized (and forcing myself to write about
it) will hopefully be helpful to me, and who knows, maybe to others, too.

** How It Works **

- I will push dated folders of stuff to this project, usually with some thoughts and some code; 

- when I have pieces I think are worth listening to, I'll post links to mp3's; 

- I'll also post bookmarks to [delicous](http://delicious.com/lamech/x); 

- to follow along, subscribe to [this RSS feed](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/lamech/x)--simple!

** Other Notes **

- I make plenty of [other music](http://boywithmachine.net/music), too.

- Big thanks to [Phillip "hiffy" Mendonca-Vieira](http://github.com/phillmv)
  for pointing me to Reg Braithwaite's
[Homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/), and big thanks to Reg for
building such a fine example of using github for this kind of code publication.
