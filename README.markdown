I find myself working differently with music than I used to. Especially these
days when time seems to feel so fragmented, much of my musical activity (both
music-making and music-listening) is interstitial -- I'm drawn to things I can
listen to and even write in between other things, in a semi-distracted state.

In particular, I've been applying my coding "chops" as a means of musical
activity, mostly in [csound](http://csounds.com); although my time is
fragmented, the musical results are certainly more composed than the stuff I've
done in the past.

Why fight it?

This is a place for me to collect little tidbits, ideas, fragments, maybe even
finished pieces. I'm figuring out how to use the materials as I go. Obviously I
want to make my own music, and that involves figuring out how to do some stuff
with this tool that I don't see other people doing. Keeping it all organized
(and forcing myself to write about it) will hopefully be helpful to me, and
who knows, maybe to others, too.

** Notes **

- I make plenty of [other music](http://boywithmachine.net/music), too.

[Homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/) blog as an example of a
way to use github to technically realize this kind of code publication.
