One of the things I've noticed about much of the published literature on
[csound](http://csounds.com) is, there's not much (or I can't find much) on
using csound itself as a *composition* platform. There's plenty on using it as
a way to study a particular DSP technique, build a funky-sounding timbre, etc.
There's plenty of info on how to use other languages and/or front-end GUI
environments to generate scores. But I haven't found much on the kind of
organic event generation from within the orchestra that I tend to use.

This is tough, because I'm still trying to figure out how to do the things I
find myself doing (which is one of my motivations for putting this blog
together).

Working with the ideas in chapter IV of Jacob Joaquin's [Exploring Analogue Synth Techniques](http://www.thumbuki.com/csound/articles/east/), I've put [this little instrument](http://github.com/lamech/x/blob/master/2009-06-05/terses.csd) together; it randomly plays with 3 different wave shapes (a sine, a cosine, and a "percussive" attack/decay shape) to produce little noise pieces.

Here are 3 runs of the instrument I particularly liked:

* [terse 5](http://boywithmachine.net/music/mp3/x/terses/terse5.mp3)
* [terse 6](http://boywithmachine.net/music/mp3/x/terses/terse6.mp3)
